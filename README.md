# portfolio

This portfolio has a setup for some of my
first web development projects. Each one
of the projects are static websites 
implementing different features.
So far this is my only "portfolio" like 
kind of website.
I hope to continue to add the different
tutorial pages that I have worked on 
thought my years developing.
